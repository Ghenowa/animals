        <p>My name is Rashad from Syria in my spare time i like to do my hobbies and my hobbies are :</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li class="t1">Surfing </li> 
            <img class="picsize" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Surfer_at_the_Cayucos_Pier%2C_Cayucos%2C_CA.jpg/1200px-Surfer_at_the_Cayucos_Pier%2C_Cayucos%2C_CA.jpg" alt="man surfing">
            <p>Surfing is a surface water
                    sport in which the wave rider, referred to as a surfer, <br>
                     rides on the forward or deep face of a moving wave,<br>
                      which is usually carrying the surfer towards the shore.<br>
                       Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found in the ocean,<br>
                        but can also be found in lakes or in rivers in the form of a standing wave or tidal bore. <br>
                        However, 
                        surfers can also utilize artificial waves such as those from boat wakes and the waves created in artificial wave pools.<br>
                    </p>

            <p>The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that usually has six strings.
                    [1] The sound is projected either acoustically, 
                    using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar),
                     or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar).
